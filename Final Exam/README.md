## Mid-Term | Final exam

This is the last test of the discipline and consists of 10 exercises that cover all the content studied during the course.

Thus, it is noteworthy that some of them can be performed using an algorithm, while others were performed manually. Those that were performed manually are in PDF format, while those developed algorithmically use the Python language.

Finally, some exercises have a composition of practical and theoretical answers, so in these folders it is common to find a python file for the practice and a pdf file for the theoretical part.

## Prerequisites
First you need to install the prerequisites and to do this you need to have **Python3** (or higher) and **pip**.
Once you have the two prerequisites mentioned, just run:
```bash
pip install -r  requirements.txt --user
```

## Running the algorithms
As mentioned, some of the exercises are answered using algorithms and can be executed via Python.

So, after installing the prerequisites, execute the following commands in the terminal, having the Final Exam as root folder.

The commands to run the algorithms are below.
```bash
python3 ex_1/ex_1.py
```
```bash
python3 ex_2/ex_2.py
```
```bash
python3 ex_5/ex_5.py
```
```bash
python3 ex_7/ex_7.py
```
```bash
python3 ex_10/ex_10.py
```
