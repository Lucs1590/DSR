# Digital Speech Recognition (DSR)
Digital Speech Recognition subject, carried out at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) by [Prof. Dr. Eng. Rodrigo Capobianco Guido](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/pesquisador/2826/rodrigo-capobianco-guido/).

Here are the algorithms developed by me:
- [Reverse audio file](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST1);
- [Convolve audio](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST2);
- [Low Pass Filter & Inverse Fourier Filter](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST3);
- [High Pass Filter & Z-Transform](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST4);
- [Band Pass & Band Stop Filter](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST5);
- [Normalization & Difference Equation](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST6);
- [Define Signal and Window](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST7);
- [Zeros and Poles](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/blob/main/ST8.pdf);
- [Type of Transfer Function](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/blob/main/ST9.pdf);
- [Pre-processing and Windowing](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST10);
- [Correlation and AMDF](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST11);
