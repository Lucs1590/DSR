Digital Speech Recognition subject, carried out at SÃ£o Paulo State University (UNESP) by [Prof. Dr. Eng. Rodrigo Capobianco Guido](https://bv.fapesp.br/pt/pesquisador/2826/rodrigo-capobianco-guido/).

Here are the algorithms developed by me:
- [Reverse audio file](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST1)
- [Convolve audio](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST2)
- [Low Pass Filter & Inverse Fourier Filter](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST3)
- [High Pass Filter & Z-Transform](https://github.com/Lucs1590/DSR/tree/main/ST4)
