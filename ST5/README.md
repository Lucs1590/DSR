# Band Pass and Band Stop Filter

# How it works?
In this exercise, a trick was performed, which by adding a low-pass filter to a high-pass filter generates a bass-stop filter. Like this, we have the case where it is possible to generate a band-pass filter by subtracting a lowpass filter with a second one.
